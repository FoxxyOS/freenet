Description: Freenet REference Daemon
 Freenet lets you anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites" (web
 sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat on forums, without fear of
 censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attack, and
 if used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very
 difficult to detect. Communications by Freenet nodes are encrypted and are
 routed through other nodes to make it extremely difficult to determine who is
 requesting the information and what its content is.
 .
 This package contains the Freenet REference Daemon (fred), which provides low
 level access to data stored on Freenet, and a web proxy for viewing freesites.
 Note that fred creates a datastore of at least 256 MB on first startup.
