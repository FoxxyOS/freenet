- have a /usr/bin/freenet so users can run freenet "directly" from the jar
- split arch-dependent JNI libs out of JAR files
  then make freenet-daemon Arch: all, with a side package Arch: any

- /var/run/freenet maybe needs to be moved.
- package the external libs properly so that we can get rid of the ant-contrib dependency
  and so that the build process does not have to dl stuff from the internet

- fred: program directories need to be put in a new section in the freenet config.
- split wrapper.conf up
